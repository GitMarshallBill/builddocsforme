.. Tip::Â When creating your vendor image master, do not boot the image. Instead, add your vendor files using a card reader on a computer, and then create an img of the card containing your vendor files. If you boot the system from your card, the filesystem will be resized to fill the card, so your resulting img will be huge. You may then have trouble re-imaging it to new cards since the capacity from card to card may vary by a byte or two.
