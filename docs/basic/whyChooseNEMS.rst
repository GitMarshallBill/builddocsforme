Why NEMS Linux?
===============

Nagios doesn’t need a big fancy supercomputer to offer exceptional
enterprise monitoring of network assets and resources, so our temptation
is to re-purpose older servers to perform this reasonably lightweight
task.

If you ask me, that’s not only overkill, but the attempt to save money
by reusing older hardware will actually cost more due to higher
electricity usage vs. a tiny Raspberry Pi 3 Microcomputer… which
ironically may in fact have more modern system specifications than that
old beast of a server you’ve been using.

It can be a wee bit daunting to setup a Raspberry Pi Nagios server from
scratch, and there were no projects I found which were actively
maintained at a level adequate for professional use. So I decided to
start a new project–called NEMS: Nagios Enterprise Monitoring Server
(for Raspberry Pi).

This project uses freely available applications such as Debian Linux,
Nagios Core and a variety of other goodies, and I too release a fully
ready-to-use image for you to use within yours or your customer’s
network environments.
